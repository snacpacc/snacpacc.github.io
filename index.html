			<h1>My Story</h1>
			<p>I was born in Altus, Oklahoma and later moved to Tulsa. After highschool I went to work and shortly after concluded I wanted more in life. I started a class here and there at the local community college, trying to decide what I wanted to do but never really felt a strong pull in any one direction. So I choose geology, being interested in structural geology and knowing people who work in the oil industry I choose, what I thought I wanted, geology. There were many signs I was pursuing the wrong major, but I either didn't pay attention or didn't understand what the signs meant. I continually had an intrest in coding, then I was in Hurricane Maria, and dealt with the aftermath. I had what you would call a "coming to Jesus moment". Admitting I made a mistake after investing so much time and money wasn't easy but I know in my bones I made the right choice. </p>

			<h1>School</h1>
			<p>I am junior at Oklahoma State University, majoring in Computer Science. I've been attending OSU since the fall semster of 2018. I've had great professors and the classes are incredibly interesting. I've previously changed majors and the difference in how much I enjoy my classes is striking. I thought I was interested in geology and it turns is that I actually didn't like geology I just loved to learn. I've never had so much fun doing work, software and web development are some of my favorite areas to work.  </p>

			<h1>Future Plans</h1>
			<p>I am planning to do some volunteer work during the semsters and maybe in the summers if time permits. I hope to get a summer internship and research project, to gain some professional experience. I'm not sure what I want to do with my Computer Science degree. I really enjoy software development, web development and I've recently been learning about backend services like databases. Machine learning and big data analysis is also very intriguing. There are some many topics it is hard to choose but all them sound really fun.</p>
